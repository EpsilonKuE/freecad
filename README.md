	* the generation of the theeth
		* create 2d-theth and give z position
		* create one tooth with BSplineSurfaces
		* rotate the shape and combine the faces
	* undercut for involute gears
	* check cycloide geometry

* Add
	* chainwheel
	* "Triebstock" cycloide gears
	* octoid for hobbed bevelgears 
	* spiral bevelgears
	* wormwheels

* Extend
	* Undercut for involute bevelgears
